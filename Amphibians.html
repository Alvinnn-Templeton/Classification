<font color="white" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><p>Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the Amphibian class. Both living amphibians belong to the Lissamphibia group. They exist in a wide range of environments, with the majority of species occurring in marine, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus, amphibians usually start out as larvae live in water, but certain species have evolved behavioral adaptations to escape this.Young people typically undergo metamorphosis from larvae with gills to adult air-breathing in the lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and certain small terrestrial salamanders and frogs have no lungs and rely solely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, as with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotic and do not need water sources in which to grow.The three modern orders of the amphibians are Anura (frogs and toads), Urodela (salamanders) and Apoda (caecilians). The number of recognized amphibian species is approximately 8,000, of which almost 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a New Guinea Frog (Paedophryne amauensis) with a length of just 7.7 mm (0.30 in).</p></font><br><br>
