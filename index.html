<p>Today we will look at classification. There are five kingdoms scientists have classified as plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and protectists. But today we will look at the kingdom of animals, in the kingdom of animals there are 2 groups, one is vertibrates. Animals with a skeleton are considered vertebrates. The backbone is a bone column that strengthens the body and also covers the spinal cord. ... Some vertebrates, such as snakes, do not have any external limbs.Animals with backbones include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. They have an <abbr title="An endoskeleton is an internal support structure of an animal, composed of mineralized tissue.">endoskeleton</abbr>and an <abbr title="An exoskeleton is the external skeleton that supports and protects an animal's body, in contrast to the internal skeleton of, for example, a human. In usage, some of the larger kinds of exoskeletons are known as shells.">exoskeleton.</abbr> While Invertebrates are animals without a backbone or bony skeleton. They range in size from microscopic mites and almost invisible flies to giant squid with soccer-ball-size eyes. This is by far the largest group in the animal kingdom: 97 percent of all animals are invertebrates. We will look at vertibrates today.</p></font><br><br>
