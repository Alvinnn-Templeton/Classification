<font color="white" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><p>Reptiles are tetrapod animals of the Reptilia class, comprising today's tortoises, crocodilians, snakes, amphibians, lizards, tuataras, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with the study of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. 

Because some reptiles are more closely related to birds than to other reptiles.
The first known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous period, having evolved from advanced reptiliomorphic tetrapods, increasingly adapted to life on dry land. Early examples include lizard-like Hylonomus and Casineria. In addition to living reptiles, many diverse groups are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events.
Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, animals that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are inherited from four-legged ancestors. In contrast to amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamous are viviparous, as were some extinct aquatic clades.</p></font><br><br>
