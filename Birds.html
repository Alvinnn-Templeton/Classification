<font color="white" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates of the Aves genus, characterized by wings, toothless beaked jaws, hard-shelled egg laying, high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a solid but light skeleton. Birds live worldwide and vary in size from 5 cm (2 in) hummingbird to 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich.
Birds are a group of feathered dinosaurs, and they are the only remaining dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are called reptiles in the current cladistic sense of the word, and their nearest living relatives are crocodilian. Birds are descendants of prehistoric avians (including Archaeopteryx) which first appeared in China around 160 million years ago (Mya).
