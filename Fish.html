<font color="white" size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"><p>Fish are gill-bearing marine cranium species that lack digit limbs. They are a sister group of tunicates, together forming olfactors. This description includes living hagfish, lamprey and cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as numerous extinct related species.The first species to be known as fish were soft-bodied chords that first appeared during the Cambrian period. While they had no true spine, they had notochords that allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate equivalents. Fish will continue to develop in the Paleozoic period, diversifying into a wide range of forms. Many Paleozoic fish developed exterior armour to shield them from predators.</p></font><br><br>
