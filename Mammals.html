<p>Mammals (from the Latin mamma 'breast') are a group of vertebrate animals belonging to the class Mammalia (/m...) and characterized by the presence of mammary glands which, in females, produce milk for feeding (nursing) their young, neocortex (brain region), fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These features differentiate them from reptiles and birds, from which they differentiated in the late Carboniferous, around 300 million years ago.In terms of cladistics, representing evolutionary background, mammals are the only surviving members of Synapsida; this cladding, along with Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), is the broader cladding of Amniota. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that included non-mammalian dimetrodone. At the end of the Carboniferous era, some 300 million years ago, this group deviated from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The basic body shape is quadrupled, and most animals use their four extremities for terrestrial locomotion; but in others, the extremities are modified for life at sea, in the clouds, in forests, underwater, or on two legs. Mammals range in size from 30–40 mm (1.2–1.6 in) bumblebee bat to 30 m (98 ft) blue whale — possibly the largest mammal known to have existed. Maximum lifespan ranges from two years in the shrew to 211 years in the bowhead whale.Many mammals are clever, those with big brains, self-awareness, and tool use. Mammals can interact and vocalize in a variety of ways, including ultrasound production, fragrance marking, warning signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organise themselves into fission-fusion communities, harems, and hierarchies — but they can also be isolated and territorial. Many mammals are polygynous, but others can be monogamous or polyanderous.
Human domestication of many forms of mammals has played a significant role in the Neolithic Transition and has resulted in agriculture replacing hunting and fishing as the main food supply for humans. This led to a massive transformation of human society, from nomad to sedentary, with greater unity between larger and larger communities, and eventually the emergence of the early civilizations.</p></font><br><br>
